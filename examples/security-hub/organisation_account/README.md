# AWS Security Hub Terraform Module for Organization Accounts Example

This module enables AWS Security Hub for an organization account. This module enables Security Hub for all AWS accounts that are current members of the target organization in AWS Organizations, turns on the Auto-Enable feature in Security Hub, which automatically enables Security Hub for any accounts that are added to the target organization in the future, and allows you to select the Regions where you want to enable Security Hub.

## Usage

To run this example you need to execute:

```
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Note that this example may create resources which cost money. Run terraform destroy when you don't need these resources.
