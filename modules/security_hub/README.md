We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 0.15](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-security-hub/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
# use this
    module "security_hub" {
    source        = "clouddrove/security-hub/aws"
    version       = "0.15.0"
    name          = "security-hub"
    security_hub_enabled = true

    #member account add
    enable_member_account = true
    member_account_id     = "123344847783"
    member_mail_id        = "example@mail.com"

    #standards 
    enabled_standards = [
    "standards/aws-foundational-security-best-practices/v/1.0.0",
    "ruleset/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark/v/1.2.0"
    ]
    #products
    enabled_products = [
    "product/aws/guardduty",
    "product/aws/inspector",
    "product/aws/macie"
    ]
    }
  
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| enable | Set to false to prevent the module from creating any resources. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| enable\_member\_account | To create member account | `bool` | `false` | no |
| enabled\_products | The possible values are:<br>- product/aws/guardduty<br>- product/aws/inspector<br>- product/aws/macie | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| enabled\_standards | The possible values are:<br>- standards/aws-foundational-security-best-practices/v/1.0.0<br>- ruleset/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark/v/1.2.0<br>- standards/pci-dss/v/3.2.1 | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| member\_account\_id | The ID of the member AWS account. | `string` | `""` | no |
| member\_mail\_id | The email of the member AWS account. | `string` | `""` | no |
| security\_hub\_enabled | To Enable seucirty-hub in aws account | `bool` | `true` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| id | The ID of the secuirty hub. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
