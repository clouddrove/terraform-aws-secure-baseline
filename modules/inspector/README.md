We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 0.12](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/clouddrove/terraform-aws-secure-baseline/modules/inspector/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
  ```hcl
  module "aws-inspector" {
    source              = "./../"
    name                = "aws-inspector"
    application         = "clouddrove"
    environment         = "test"
    label_order         = ["environment", "application", "name"]
    enabled             = true
    instance_tags       = {
        "Inspector" = true
    }
    inspector_enabled   = true
    duration            = 300
    rules_package_arns  = [
      "arn:aws:inspector:eu-west-1:357557129151:rulespackage/0-ubA5XvBh",
      "arn:aws:inspector:eu-west-1:357557129151:rulespackage/0-sJBhCr0F",
      "arn:aws:inspector:eu-west-1:357557129151:rulespackage/0-SPzU33xe",
      "arn:aws:inspector:eu-west-1:357557129151:rulespackage/0-SnojL3Z6",
    ]
    lambda_enabled      = true
    schedule_expression = "cron(0/10 * ? * MON-FRI *)"
    handler             = "index.handler"
    runtime             = "nodejs12.x"
    statement_ids       = ["AllowExecutionFromEvents"]
    actions             = ["lambda:InvokeFunction"]
    principals          = ["events.amazonaws.com"]
    iam_actions = [
      "inspector:StartAssessmentRun",
      "logs:CreateLogGroup",
      "logs:CreateLogStream",
      "logs:PutLogEvents"
    ]
  }
  ```
**Note:** We have to install agent in every instances which need to be inspect by AWS Inspector.

| resource_group | The resource group ARN. |
| tags | The tags of aws inspector. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
