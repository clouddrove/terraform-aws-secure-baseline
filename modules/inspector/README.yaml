  ### Simple Example
  Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
    ```hcl
    module "aws-inspector" {
      source              = "./../"
      name                = "aws-inspector"
      application         = "clouddrove"
      environment         = "test"
      label_order         = ["environment", "application", "name"]
      enabled             = true
      instance_tags       = {
          "Inspector" = true
      }
      inspector_enabled   = true
      duration            = 300
      rules_package_arns  = [
        "arn:aws:inspector:eu-west-1:357557129151:rulespackage/0-ubA5XvBh",
        "arn:aws:inspector:eu-west-1:357557129151:rulespackage/0-sJBhCr0F",
        "arn:aws:inspector:eu-west-1:357557129151:rulespackage/0-SPzU33xe",
        "arn:aws:inspector:eu-west-1:357557129151:rulespackage/0-SnojL3Z6",
      ]
      lambda_enabled      = true
      schedule_expression = "cron(0/10 * ? * MON-FRI *)"
      handler             = "index.handler"
      runtime             = "nodejs12.x"
      statement_ids       = ["AllowExecutionFromEvents"]
      actions             = ["lambda:InvokeFunction"]
      principals          = ["events.amazonaws.com"]
      iam_actions = [
        "inspector:StartAssessmentRun",
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ]
    }
    ```
  **Note:** We have to install agent in every instances which need to be inspect by AWS Inspector.
