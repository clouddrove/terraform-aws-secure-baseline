We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 0.13](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-ec2/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
    module "ec2" {
      source = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-ec2.git?ref=tags/0.12.3"
      name        = "ec2-instance"
      application = "clouddrove"
      environment = "test"
      label_order = ["environment", "application", "name"]        instance_count = 2
      ami            = "ami-08d658f84a6d84a80"
      instance_type  = "t2.nano"
      key_name       = module.keypair.name
      monitoring     = false
      tenancy        = "default"
      vpc_security_group_ids_list = [module.ssh.security_group_ids, module.http-https.security_group_ids]
      subnet_ids                  = tolist(module.public_subnets.public_subnet_id)
      assign_eip_address          = true
      associate_public_ip_address = true
      instance_profile_enabled = true
      iam_instance_profile     = module.iam-role.name
      disk_size          = 8
      ebs_optimized      = false
      ebs_volume_enabled = true
      ebs_volume_type    = "gp2"
      ebs_volume_size    = 30
      user_data     = "./_bin/user_data.sh"
      instance_tags = { "snapshot" = true }
      dns_zone_id = "Z1XJD7SSBKXLC1"
      hostname    = "ec2"
    }
```

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
