We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 0.12](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/clouddrove/terraform-aws-secure-baseline/modules/guardduty/releases).


Here are examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### Single Account
```hcl
  module "guardduty" {
  source      = "./../"
  name        = "guardduty"
  application = "clouddrove"
  environment = "test"
  label_order = ["environment", "application", "name"]

  guardduty_enable = true
  ipset_iplist = ["10.10.0.0/16", "172.16.0.0/16",]
  bucket_name    = "guardduty-bucket-name"
  threatintelset_activate = true
  threatintelset_iplist = ["192.168.2.0/32", "4.4.4.4",]
  enabled = true
  variables = {
    minSeverityLevel = "LOW"
    webHookUrl = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/TEE0GFsHJ0QZ/BSDFGT97PJB/vMt86BHwetertUUrUxpzNYzuEG4TW"
    slackChannel = "#testing"
  }
}
```

### Multi Account
  ```hcl
  module "guardduty" {
    source      = "./../"
    name        = "guardduty"
    application = "clouddrove"
    environment = "test"
    label_order = ["environment", "application", "name"]

    guardduty_enable = true
    ipset_iplist = ["10.10.0.0/16", "172.16.0.0/16",]
    bucket_name    = "clouddrove-guardduty-bucket-name"
    threatintelset_activate = true
    threatintelset_iplist = ["192.168.2.0/32", "4.4.4.4",]
    is_guardduty_member = true
    member_list = [{
      account_id = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
      email      = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
      invite     = true
    }]
    enabled = true
    variables = {
      minSeverityLevel = "LOW"
      webHookUrl = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/TEE0GFsHJ0QZ/BSDFGT97PJB/vMt86BHwetertUUrUxpzNYzuEG4TW"
      slackChannel = "#testing"
    }
  }
  ```

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
