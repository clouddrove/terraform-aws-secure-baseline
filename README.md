We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards stratergies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 0.12](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-alarm-baseline/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
      module "cloudtrail" {
      source = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-baseline.git?ref=tags/0.12.1"
      name        = "trails"
      application = "clouddrove"
      environment = "test"
      label_order = ["environment", "application", "name"]
      enabled                           = true
      iam_role_name                     = "CloudTrail-CloudWatch-Delivery-Role"
      iam_role_policy_name              = "CloudTrail-CloudWatch-Delivery-Policy"
      account_type                      = "individual"
      key_deletion_window_in_days       = 10
      cloudwatch_logs_retention_in_days = 365
      cloudwatch_logs_group_name        = "cloudtrail-log-group"
      s3_bucket_name                    = "logs-bucket"
    }
      module "alarm_baseline" {
      source = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-alarm-baseline.git?ref=tags/0.12.1"
      enabled                   = true
      alarm_namespace           = "CISBenchmark"
      cloudtrail_log_group_name = module.cloudtrail.log_group.name
    }
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| alarm_namespace | The namespace in which all alarms are set up. | string | `CISBenchmark` | no |
| application | Application (e.g. `cd` or `clouddrove`). | string | `` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | list | `<list>` | no |
| cloudtrail_log_group_name | The name of the CloudWatch Logs group to which CloudTrail events are delivered. | string | - | yes |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `organization`, `environment`, `name` and `attributes`. | string | `-` | no |
| enabled | The boolean flag whether this module is enabled or not. No resources are created when set to false. | string | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | string | `` | no |
| label_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | list | `<list>` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | string | `` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. map(`BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`). | map | `<map>` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| alarm_sns_topic | The SNS topic to which CloudWatch Alarms will be sent. |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
