We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards stratergies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure.

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies:

- [Terraform 0.12](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-secure-baseline/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
module "secure_baseline" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-secure-baseline.git?ref=tags/0.12.2"
  application = "clouddrove"
  environment = "test"
  label_order = ["environment", "application", "name"]
  enabled                           = true
  key_deletion_window_in_days       = 10
  cloudwatch_logs_retention_in_days = 365
  cloudwatch_logs_group_name        = "cloudtrail-log-group"
  alarm_namespace                   = "Alert_Alarm"
  s3_bucket_name                    = "cloudtrail-bucket"
  config_s3_bucket_name             = "config-bucket"
  slack_webhook                     = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/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uEG4TW"
  slack_channel                     = "testing"
  s3_policy                         = data.aws_iam_policy_document.default.json
  guardduty_enable = true
  ipset_iplist = ["10.10.0.0/16", "172.16.0.0/16",]
  threatintelset_activate = true
  threatintelset_iplist = ["192.168.2.0/32", "4.4.4.4",]
  is_guardduty_member = false
   member_list = [{
    account_id = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    email      = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    invite     = true
}]
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "default" {
  statement {
    sid = "AWSCloudTrailAclCheck"

    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"]
    }

    actions = [
      "s3:GetBucketAcl",
    ]

    resources = ["arn:aws:s3:::cloudtrail-bucket-logs"]
  }

  statement {
    sid = "AWSCloudTrailWrite"

    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"]
    }

    actions = [
      "s3:PutObject",
    ]

    resources = compact(
      concat(
        [format("arn:aws:s3:::cloudtrail-bucket-logs/AWSLogs/%s/*", data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id)]
      )
    )

    condition {
      test     = "StringEquals"
      variable = "s3:x-amz-acl"

      values = [
        "bucket-owner-full-control",
      ]
    }
  }
}

```

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system.

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
